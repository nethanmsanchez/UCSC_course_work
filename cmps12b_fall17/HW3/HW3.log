Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 0
In output file, ./negmsanc/HW3/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: 4 2 4 3 illegal

In correct output file, line is: legal


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
